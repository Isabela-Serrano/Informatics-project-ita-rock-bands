      <p>Good morning, everyone! This project was carried out by two girls coming from different parts of the world but united by the passion for the study of languages. 
</p>

<p>
First, we have Camilla, the Italian student. Camilla is a 23-year-old young woman who has always been fascinated by languages and their ability to connect people from different backgrounds. Growing up in Italy, she was exposed to the rich history and artistic heritage of her country. Camilla has a deep appreciation for the various dialects spoken throughout Italy, each carrying its own unique nuances. Through her studies in Language, Society, and Communication, Camilla aims to enhance her understanding of foreign languages and explore how communication shapes society. 
</p>

<p>
Next, we have Isabela, the Brazilian student. Isabela hails from a lively city in Brazil and has spent her formative years immersed in the vibrant Brazilian culture. Portuguese is her native language, but Isabela has always had a passion for learning new languages. Being a sociable person, Isabela believes that effective communication is key to fostering mutual understanding among people. By pursuing her studies in Language, Society, and Communication, Isabela intends to delve into the ways different languages influence society and how communication can bridge cultural barriers. 
</p>

<p>
These two young women, Camilla and Isabela, have come together to study because of their shared passion for language and communication. They both believe that cultural diversity brings unique challenges to communication, but they also recognize that mutual understanding can lead to a more harmonious world. 
</p>

<p>
Moreover, both girls are excited about applying what they have learned throughout their academic journey. They aspire to work in fields such as translation, interpretation, intercultural communication, or even in media and public relations, where they can leverage their language skills and their understanding of society. </p>
