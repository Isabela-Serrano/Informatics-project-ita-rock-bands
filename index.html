      <h1>Italian Rock Bands</h1>
      <p>
        This project was made for the purpose of an academic evaluation for the course "Information and technology skills" given by the professor Valentina Presutti. This course is part of the international Master "Language, Society and Communication" from the University of Bologna.  
      </p>

      <p>
       It revolves around creating a data story in the "Melody" website about music and music history. Our stories are data-driven, much like news stories crafted by data journalists. We have drawn inspiration from data journalism, which involves analyzing large datasets to create or support compelling news stories. In our case, we have explored the Polifonia corpora using the Corpus interrogation tool and delved into the Wikidata knowledge graph using SPARQL.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have approached this in two ways: either by starting from the data itself and identifying interesting facts, or by formulating hypotheses and questions, and then using data to test and support them. Creating the stories has been a challenging but interesting journey on Melody, that led us far away from our standard field of studies. It was a way of stepping out of our comfort study zone and expanding our knowledge.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The next step was the creation of a website, which is published on GitHub, ensuring its accessibility to the wider community. On the website, you will find an article that encapsulates the essence of our story and that gives the academic foundation to the project along with the data found. Furthermore, the website contains a comprehensive project report, providing insights into the methodology adopted throughout the creation process and a thorough description of each step of the project that discusses the tools employed, such as the Melody website and other relevant resources. The report also sheds light on the data sources we utilized. We have dedicated a section to discussing the challenges we encountered and the strategies we employed to overcome them.
