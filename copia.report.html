      <h2 style="color: #622b78">STEP 1: Creation of a Melody Story</h2>
      <P><P>
      <p>
        The first part of this project consists of the creation of a Melody story on the Melody website using knowledge graphs. First it was necessary the creation of a Melody account. Clicking on "start now" on the website it was possible to start the creation of our data story.  
      </p>

      <p>
       To start we had to choose the theme and the final theme was "Italian Rock Bands". We decided to show a little about their history, most popular bands and their members, period of creation of those bands, influences on them. All of it restricting the period of time from the 60s until current days. Our hypothesis was that those bands had a great influence on Italian culture and that it was influenced by American rock. 
      </p>

      <p>
        To prove our hypothesis, we used SPARQL queries to search the database. The database chosen was the WIKIDATA. In the WIKIDATA we searched for pre-established codes (for example: the Italy country code is Q38) and we added them to our search queries following the examples given by the professor on the site of WIKIDATA query.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the query was checked on WIKIDATA we added it on the Melody website with the template and color of our choosing. It could be a count, a line chart, a doughnut chat, a table, or any other kind of template the website provides. After our queries were correctly read, we moved the information up or down to create a storyline.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the work, several types of queries were used depending on the information required. We wanted to know about Italian bands, rock bands, monthly listeners, start dates of the bands, and other filters that would complement this story, so we needed to go through the same process explained before: check the code of what we were looking for on WIKIDATA, create a search query to give the data need, check the data, put it on the Melody website.  
      </p>
                                                                                       
      <p>
        Counters were used to know the total number of Italian bands and the number of Italian rock bands. For graphics, melody asked us to give the result of two variables to build the bar chart and the doughnut chart could use more than two variables. We also used tables to show information such as bands created by year. For this we took the year of the creation date of the band and counted how many bands had the date in the same year. The table showed the year and how many Italian rock bands were created in each year. Another table was used to show examples of rock bands giving their names and pictures.  
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #622b78">STEP 2: Writing an article</h2>        
      <P><P>   
      <p>
        After the story was finished on the Melody website, we started looking for a number of academic papers to support our hypothesis and the data found and also to give us a deeper understanding of the theme to write an article about it. We found a lot of bibliographic content that allowed us to dive in the story of the Italian rock music. 
      </p>

      <p>
       After we read the material, we started to write the article that consists of 763 words about Italian rock music, the bands from this genre and the influence it had in the country. The article is provided on the page "article" in this website.  
      </p>
      
      <P><P>                          
      <h2 style="color: #622b78">Step 3: HTML codes  </h2>        
      <P><P>   
      <p>
        As a part of the project, we had to publish a webpage on the GitHub website, for that we used HTML to create the pages of our site.  
      </p>

      <p>
       The HTML pages were made as the following example:  
      </p>         
                                
      <p>
       For the texts, we used h1 style="color: #622b78 "Title /h1 for titles, h2 style="color: #622b78" Subtitle /h2 for the subtitles, p PARAGRAPH /p for paragraphs. A navigation bar was also created.  
      </p>    
                                                                                                       
      <p>
       To create the codes, we used the tutorials from the website W3schools provided by the professor in class. After we concluded all codes, we saved the file in .html extension.
      </p>                                                                                                           

      <P><P>                          
      <h2 style="color: #622b78">Step 4: GitHub website</h2>        
      <P><P>   
      <p>
        After we created a GitHub account, we made a collaborative repository named  "italian-rock-bands" to work on it and publish our website. We uploaded the HTML files and made the final adjustments to make the website as good as possible.  
      </p>

      <p>
       After we finished, we published the website in "settings" selecting the source and branch that we would use. We followed the instructions given in the project guidelines.  
      </p>     
                                                                
      <P><P>                          
      <h2 style="color: #622b78">Step 5: Slide presentation</h2>        
      <P><P>                                   
      <p>
       As a final step to the project, we created a slide presentation including an overview of the Melody story, methodology and tools that we used and our conclusions. The presentation was scheduled for the 9th of June.  
      </p>     
                                
      <P><P>                          
      <h2 style="color: #622b78">Challenges:</h2>        
      <P><P>   
      <p>
        This project was something new and different from everything we had worked on before. We were not familiar with the tools, and we struggled to understand how they worked. We also faced a lot of challenges with the Polifonia Corpus once we could not find enough data, or the website would say that it had the data, but it wouldn’t show anything.  
      </p>

      <p>
       With the WIKIDATA we also had difficulty finding data. We would research what we wanted on the main website, but when we changed the query to get the results we found on the main website, we wouldn’t get the same information or even there would be a lack of information.
      </p>         
                                
      <p>
       The lack of data on the tools provided was so much so that we decided to change our theme. At first, we were going to compare man and women in Italian opera music, but there wasn’t enough information on the Polifonia Corpus, and we couldn’t get it on the WIKIDATA query.
      </p>    
                                                                                                       
      <p>
       Creating the Melody story was difficult. It took many hours so we could understand how it worked. Some queries would work on the WIKIDATA query but would not work on the Melody website, so we had to change it many times until it did or just give up on information because the query wouldn’t be read. The HTML files were also complicated to make once we were not familiar with it.  
      </p>                                               
                     
     <P><P>                          
      <h2 style="color: #622b78">Conclusion: </h2>        
      <P><P>   
      <p>
        This project was completely different from anything we had ever done before, but it was a nice way to learn more about music, data and technology, providing new information and giving us new skills.
